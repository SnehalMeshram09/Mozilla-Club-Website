                    Hacktoberfest is a month-long event conducted globally to celebrate open source contributions every October. The purpose of organizing this event is to get as many people as possible involved in open source. This fest gave open source newbies a hands-on experience and a chance to explore more about contributing to open source projects through Github.

                    The club made sure to provide every detail via mail and WhatsApp to the students. In the first mail, we briefed them about Hacktoberfest and provided a registration link to participate in the event. A second mail was sent with a link to a WhatsApp group where students could get their doubts cleared. The registrations started on the 26th of September, and Hacktoberfest was conducted for the entire month of October. The women of CCOEW took great interest in contributing to open source projects.
