                    ASME-CCOEW teamed up with Mozilla Campus Club of CCOEW for the successful launch of Phase 2 of the ASME website. This was part of a project aimed at improving and upgrading the website, following feedback from the ASME Student Section. The event saw enthusiastic student participation, focusing on making the website more user-friendly, optimized, and mobile-friendly.

                <p style="margin-bottom: 20px;">
                    To manage the development efficiently, Mozilla Campus Club created a GitHub repository, enabling students to work on specific issues. Through GitHub, students gained experience in open-source collaboration, with all contributions being reviewed and merged in real-time.
